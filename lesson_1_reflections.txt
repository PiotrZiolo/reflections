How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows only changes that have been made, so I can notice them much easier.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can track changes, I can roll back, if something goes wrong.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros:
	* you do not use too much disk space
	* you have precisely the key versions that are somehow meaningful
	
	Cons:
	* you can forget to commit and lose your progress

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is for projects consisting of many files, while Google Docs is for working on one file, without dependencies between files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    ?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    After the changes I can always roll back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'll be starting some projects in near future, so I'll use Git for them.
