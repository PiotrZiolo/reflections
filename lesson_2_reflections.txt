What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates files with basic information about the repository. It allows to use other Git functions, e.g. commit.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	I suppose that files in the staging area are not physically copied from the working directory, but only listed as staged. It gives the possibility to commit only a part of changes made to files. It allows to left unfinished work uncommited.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

	I can use git diff --staged to be sure if there's just one logical change, and then I can commit.
	
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

	Branches are helful when you want to develop an alternate version of the program or you want to test something, and you don't want it to interfere with the main version of the code.
	
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	Thx to diagrams you have a clear visual representation of the relationships between commits.
	
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

	As a result we get one version (one commit) having changes made on the two branches. The representation of it clearly shows that two branches have been merged into one commit.
	
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

	In simple cases we can have a lot of work done for us with no risk of breaking the code.
