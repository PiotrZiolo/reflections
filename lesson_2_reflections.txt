What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Git creates files with basic information about the repository. It allows to use other Git functions, e.g. commit.
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	I suppose that files in the staging area are not physically copied from the working directory, but only listed as staged. It gives the possibility to commit only a part of changes made to files. It allows to left unfinished work uncommited.
