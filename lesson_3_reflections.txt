When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	It's always advisable, since this is a safe backup of the code. And it's absolutely necessary when you work on the code with other people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If this was done automatically, Git would overwrite my work from time to time. It would be nonsense.
