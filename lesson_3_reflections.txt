When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	It's always advisable, since this is a safe backup of the code. And it's absolutely necessary when you work on the code with other people.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	If this was done automatically, Git would overwrite my work from time to time. It would be nonsense.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork - to make a copy of a repository on GitHub for myself.
	Clone - to make a copy of a remote repository on my computer.
	Branch - to make a separate version of the code in the local repository.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	There may be some changes made since our last pull, hence it's necessary to have the most recent copy of the remote and merge it into our code.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I would use e-mail to exchange files and compare changes with WinMerge. This would give quite an overhead for writing and sending e-mails and merging everything manually.
	
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	When I work on something experimental or on another functionality and many people are working on the code. It allows good code control through pull requests.
